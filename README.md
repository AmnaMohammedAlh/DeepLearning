# Deep Learning Model:
Core machine learning infrastructure for the LifeHarmony recommender system. 

## 1. Model Architecture (
pythondef build_harmony_model(input_dim, output_dim, hidden_layers=[128, 64, 32]):

* Architecture: A feed-forward neural network with configurable hidden layers
* Input: User attributes and domain priorities (14 features total)
Processing:

- Input normalization with BatchNormalization
- Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout (30%) to prevent overfitting


* Output: Multi-label classification for recommendations using sigmoid activation
* Training: Uses Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function

This architecture is well-suited for a recommendation system as it allows the model to learn complex relationships between user attributes and appropriate recommendations.

## 2. Data Preparation (prepare_data)

* Input Processing:

- Converts categorical features (marital status, occupation, etc.) to numerical values
- Creates a fixed-length feature vector for each user
- Includes both user attributes and life domain priorities


* Output Processing:

- Creates a multi-hot encoding for recommendations
- Each recommendation is treated as a binary classification problem


* Feature Scaling:

- Uses StandardScaler to normalize age and budget
- Preserves categorical encodings for other features


* Data Splitting:

- 80% training, 20% validation with fixed random seed for reproducibility



3. Model Training (train_model)
pythondef train_model(dataset_path="generated_datasets/4_generated_dataset_with_recommendations.xlsx", model_save_path="harmony_deep_model"):

Training Process:

Uses early stopping to prevent overfitting
Monitors validation loss to determine optimal training duration
Uses batch size of 32 and maximum 100 epochs


Model Persistence:

Saves the trained model in H5 format
Stores recommendation mappings and feature scaler in pickle files
This enables later recommendation generation without retraining



4. Recommendation Generation (get_recommendations)
pythondef get_recommendations(user_features, model_path="harmony_deep_model.h5", recommendations_path="harmony_deep_model_recommendations.pkl", scaler_path="harmony_deep_model_scaler.pkl", threshold=0.3, top_k=10):

Input Processing:

Takes a feature vector representing a user
Applies the same scaling used during training


Prediction Strategy:

Generates probability scores for all possible recommendations
Uses a hybrid approach for recommendation selection:

First tries threshold-based selection (recommendations with probability > 0.3)
If too few or too many recommendations, falls back to top-k selection




Output:

Returns a list of relevant recommendations



Integration with User Interfaces
This model module is designed to work with different interfaces:

Notebook Interface: The training process can be run in a Jupyter notebook
Streamlit Interface: The model can generate recommendations for the web UI
Terminal Interface: The model works with the command-line interface we created

Technical Considerations

Dependencies:

TensorFlow for model building and training
Pandas for data handling
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing
Pickle for object serialization


Computational Requirements:

The model is relatively lightweight (3 hidden layers)
Should run on most modern computers without specialized hardware
Training might benefit from GPU acceleration but isn't required


Scalability:

The current design handles a fixed set of recommendations
Adding new recommendations would require retraining


Error Handling:

The current implementation has minimal error handling
The terminal interface we created adds robustness with fallback recommendations
